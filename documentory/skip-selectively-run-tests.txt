1) Skip tests ==> (To skip any of the test function for not testing of now)

 Example:
  import pytest
  @pytest.mark.skip(reason='I don"t want to test as of now')
  def test_calc_total_v2():
    total = mathlib.calc_total(10,20)
    assert total == 30

2) selectively run tests using their name ==>

    Below command use to only run only the test fuctions which are containing function name as
    "multipy":
    >> pytest -k multipy -v

3) Custom markers ==>(If you wnat to run some test only depend on os)

    As below example we want to run some test in windows & other on mac system only

    import pytest

    @pytest.mark.windows
    def test_windows_1():
        assert True

    @pytest.mark.windows
    def test_windows_2():
        assert true

    @pytest.mark.mac
    def test_mac_1():
        assert True

    @pytest.mark.mac
    def test_mac_2():
        assert True

    Follow the below command to run only windows oriented tests:
      >> pytest -m  windows -v

    Follow the below command to run only mac oriented tests:
      >> pytest -m  mac -v

    Follow the below command to run all test except for windows:
      >> pytext -m "not windows" -v
