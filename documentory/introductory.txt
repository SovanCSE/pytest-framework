Unit Test:
    Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
    source code are tested to determine whether they are fit to use.
    A good programmer always write some automated test to perform some test
    cases.

Python provide three basic framework to perform this testing stuff:
 1. unittest
 2. nose
 3. pytest
Among on this pytest is best(will discuss later why pytest best)

To install the pytest run the below simple command:

 >> pip install pytest

 Pytest discovery rules:===>

  Rule 1:
      All unit test function & file name must have to start with test underscore(test_) keyword as
      prefix to understand the pytest that following function or file is written for testing
      purpose.

     Running ways:
      If you run the below commands then this gonna to look for all files & subdirectories
      from  current localtion which is having prefix as test underscore(test_) after that
      inside of those files gonna to run all functions which is having  prefix as test
      underscore(test_).
      >> python -m pytest
      or
      >> py.test
      or
      >> pytest
      or
      >> python -m pytest {testÂ directory}  ==> Manually youcan pass your test directory also

      Below command use to list down your test file with passed or failed status:
       >> py.test -v

      Below command use to get list down test fiel with status & messages on reason skip:
       >> py.test -v -rxs
